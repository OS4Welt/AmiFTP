		FindAminet 1.15 for AmiFTP

		© 1996 Sami Itkonen


		Purpose:

To find and get files from Aminet with AmiFTP, using Aminet findservers which exist in 
some Aminet sites.


		Requirements:

AmigaOS 2.04 or higher
AmiFTP 1.149 or higher
AmiTCP installed since the script needs the TCP:-device
rexxreqtools.library   (At the time of writing aminet:util/rexx/rexxreqtools.lha, also
			part of the reqtools distribution)
rexxdossupport.library (.. aminet:util/rexx/RexxDosSupport.lha)
amigaguide.library


		Installation:

copy Find.AmiFTP rexx:
protect rexx:Find.AmiFTP +s


		Usage: 

[rx] Find.AmiFTP [-e] ["substring"|"substrings"] [-m<maxhits>] [-s<sitename>] [-p<portname>] 
		 [-f<findsite number>] [-w<width>] [-c<0|1>]

Explanation of the options: 
		-e  	- tells the Aminet findserver to look for the exact string
		-m<maxhits> - defines the maximum number hits the findserver should return.
		-s<sitename> - the Aminet site to use
		-p<portname> - The Arexx portname of AmiFTP FindAminet
		-f<findsite number> - the number of the findsite to use (more on this below)
		-w<width> - the width of the lines the findserver should return (not all
			findservers understand this command)
		-c<0|1> - will force crap filtering on (1) or off (0). Any other number will
			be ignored.

Arguments can be freely mixed on the command line. Any argument not beginning with a hyphen ('-') 
will be taken as a part of the string to find. If no string is specified, you will be prompted
with a reqtools requester to enter a string. You can enter options in that requester, too.
If any files are found, an amigaguide file will be popped up (See section Getting files).


		Configuration:

The following variables can be configured (by editing the script) for customization:

dldir 		- Your default download directory
AmiFTP_bin 	- The full path to your AmiFTP binary. Set this if you don't have 
		  AmiFTP in your command path.
sitename	- The default Aminet site to use
pubscreen	- The public screen to use
viewmethod	- Defines the method to 'view' downloaded files. 'builtin' will try
		  to use AmiFTP's builtin VIEW command (more on this in the AmiFTP
		  documentation). 'processfile' will use 'rexx:processfile.rexx', which
		  comes with eg. Grapevine. Any other setting will disable viewing.
filtercrap	- If set to 1, will filter out all files in directories that match 
		  'filterpat', which is a valid AmigaDOS pattern.
filterpat	- The pattern to filter out files in unwanted directories.
width		- The default display width
maxhits		- The default number of maximum hits
fsitenum	- The number of the default Aminet findsite. Possible choices are:
			1 - Using site ftp.wustl.edu
			2 -     ...    amiga.icu.net.ch
			3 -     ...    haegar2.uni-paderborn.de


		Getting files:

Whether the script finds files or not, it will popup an amigaguide file containing
the hits. If there are none, there will only be a gadget named 'Search for a new file',
which will call Find.AmiFTP script again. The Aminet site and findsite used and the portname
for the script will be propagated to next script. 
Those files found will be in the following format:

[     Filename	    ]	Directory  Size  Age¹ [ Description ]

Clicking on the 'filename' gadget will download the file and optionally try to
view/process it, depending on the 'viewmethod' configuration variable. Clicking
on 'description' gadget will download and view the Readme of the file.

¹) Some findsites do not supply this
