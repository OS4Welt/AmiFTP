Hi!

It's been a while since the last new strings but now I have some new 
strings that I would like to have translated:

The first string will be in a button below 'Bottom' in the SiteList-Window
and when pressing it AmiFTP will sort the sites alphabetically.

SLW_Sort

;_Sort

The second string will be next to the 'Directory' stringgadget in the mainwindow
when pressing it AmiFTP will reload the current directory and update the cache.

MW_Reload

; _Reload

I have also added some more status-strings when connecting to a site:

CW_SendingLogin

;Sending login...
CW_SendingPassword

;Sending password...
CW_ChangingDirectory

;Changing directory...

Also, as some of you know know I'm planning to make AmiFTP a 
shareware program when I release the first version on Aminet.
The first version will not be crippled in any way (don't know
about later versions), and the shareware fee will be something
like $10 to $15. Since nothing is crippled there's no need for
keyfiles either (and if I added keyfiles someone would either
crack the keyfile or patch AmiFTP).

You, as a translator, are already a registered user, that means
you don't have to pay any registration fee.

Since I'm making AmiFTP into a shareware program I want your
approval of including your translation(s) in the archive.

Regards/
