@Welcome to AmiFTP!

Before trying to use AmiFTP you need to run the supplied Install_AmiFTP.
AmiFTP needs ClassAct. Get the latest version from 
ftp://ftp.warped.com/pub/amiga/classact/

I suggest you use the new AT Installer (v43) which can be found
on Aminet.

Note that AmiFTP is Shareware. See AmiFTP.guide for more information.

If someone wants to do the Norwegian and Dutch translations please
contact me. (well, you don't have to do both yourself ;)

Minor updates of AmiFTP will be made available at 
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~lilja/amiftp/ and
ftp://eniac.campus.luth.se/pub/amiga/amiftp/

Major updates will appear on Aminet.

If you are using an old version of AmiFTP (the 0.wxyz versions) you have
to remove the 'Assign add libs: <amiftp-dir>' if you made such an assign.

Merry Christmas (for those of you who celebrate it) and a Happy New Year!

IMPORTANT: This version uses ClassAct (Copyright Phantom Development). 
If you have the old ClassAct-demo installed make sure that the gadgets/
classes/images that you have installed are atleast as new as the ones
supplied in this archive.

If you don't have ClassAct installed before, you can either copy window.class
to sys:classes/ , Gadgets/ to sys:classes/Gadgets and Images/ sys:classes/Images
or just do an 'assign add libs: work:amiftp/' if you unpacked AmiFTP on your
work:-partition.

I have included a sample preferences file for AmiFTP, but it's renamed to 
AmiFTP2.prefs, so old users won't get the wrong config-file (or overwrite
their old). So if you are a new user you can either rename it to AmiFTP.prefs
and start AmiFTP or go to the menu item "Settings/Load settings..." and load
that file. It contains some useful Amiga ftp-sites.

Also, this version comes with locale-catalogs for the Danish, Dutch, German, 
Italian, Norwegian and Swedish users.

Many thanks to: Volker Graf (vgraf@@hydra.informatik.uni-ulm.de) for the 
                Danish and German translations.
                Giacomo Magnini (G.Magnini@@@@agora.stm.it) for the Italian
                translation.
                Troels Walsted Hansen (troels@@stud.cs.uit.no) for the 
                Norwegian translation.
                Arno van Wouwe (apwouwe@@cs.vu.nl) for the Dutch translation.
                Osma Ahvenlampi (Osma.Ahvenlampi@@hut.fi) for the Finnish translation

Mail them (or me) any thoughts about the translations.

The Swedish translation is made by me (with a bit help from Andreas Johansson)
and I'm interested in all sorts of comments on it.

Note that this is a beta-program. I really want to hear your suggestions/bugreports
and your thoughts about the program. 

I have included a NewCatalog.ct (located in the Catalogs/ dir) with which you 
can make your own locale catalog for AmiFTP. If you are satisfied with your 
translation please don't hesitate to mail it to me!
