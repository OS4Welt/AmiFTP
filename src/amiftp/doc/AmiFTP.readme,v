@Short:    Easy to use GUI FTP client for OS 2.0+

Title

   AmiFTP

Version

   1.607

Description

   AmiFTP is an easy to use ftp-client with a GUI built on the
   ClassAct BOOPSI system. Some of the features are:

   * Localized (Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, 
     Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish catalogs are available at the moment)

   * Aminet-mode

   * ARexx interface

   * Resume transfer

   * Multiselect when up/downloading files

   * Caches the latest directories

   * Has hotlist with submenus

   * Online AmigaGuide-help

   Make sure to use the installerscript and follow the instructions there
   before you start AmiFTP. This is really necessary in order to install
   the ClassAct classes on your system.


History

   AmiFTP now has an Aminet-mode, in which AmiFTP works like an ADT-client that
   keeps track of when you last visited Aminet.

Requirements

   AmigaOS 2.0 or higher.
   reqtools.library

   One of the following TCP/IP stacks:
   AmiTCP 3.x or higher
   AS225r2,
   I-Net 225,
   CPR TCP/IP Base Kit
   or mlink.

   AmiFTP also needs ClassAct gadgets, which are included in this 
   archive.

Price

   AmiFTP is Shareware. This version is not crippled in any way which
   means that there's no extra features available for those who
   register, but this shouldn't stop you from supporting this program.
   The Shareware fee is $15. See the documentation in the archive
   for more information.

   The major new features are the possibility to have submenus in the hotlist and
   that AmiFTP now supports both bsdsocket.library (AmiTCP) and socket.library
   (as225-alike) TCP/IP-stacks in one binary.
   The ARexx command-set has also been extended. An aminet search script written
   in ARexx (by Sami Itkonen) is also included.
