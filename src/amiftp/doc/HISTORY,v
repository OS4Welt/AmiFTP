@Version History for AmiFTP

   First a note about the version numbering: AmiFTP will use following
   scheme, majorversion.revision (just like the libraries on your system).
   That means that 1.11 is newer that 1.1, and 1.201 is newer than 1.200
   and 1.20 and so on...

   Known bugs: ARexx-bugs. I will look at this soon.
               stem.FILELIST.n.* doesn't work at the moment.

   1.801 (released 1996-11-30)
   ===========================

   Fixed a bug with the filerequester in the global preferences window.
   The bug only seemed to appear on some systems (not mine).

   1.797 (released 1996-11-06)
   ===========================

   Recompiled with SAS/C 6.57.

   Beginning with this version ClassAct will no longer be included in the
   archive. ClassAct is used by so many programs now so you probably already 
   have it. If not, go to ftp://ftp.warped.com/pub/amiga/classact/ .

   Not all language catalogs have been updated.

   Sometimes you had to press HELP two times in order to get the online
   help. Fixed now.

   Speedbar added, and preferences to turn on/off the speedbar and the normal
   buttons.

   ClassAct no longer included in the archive. Get the latest version from
   ftp.warped.com/pub/amiga/classact/ .

   All button-actions are duplicated as menu items.

   Bug in the progressbar fixed.

   AmiFTP starts even if no TCP/IP-stack is running.

   You can now select files by entering a AmigaDOS-pattern (in the Files-menu).

   You can use the cursor keys to scroll the filelist. (and use shift/alt to
   scroll a page/go to top/bottom).

   Various minor things fixed.

   1.607 (released 1996-07-01)
   ===========================

   Due to a bug in the current penmap.image, AmiFTP won't work on AmigaOS 2.x,
   but when penmap.image has been fixed it will.
   
   A NewIcon-style icon for AmiFTP has been included as well as a KMI-style
   dock-icon. Thanks to Phil Vedovatti and Heikki Kantola.

   Pressing cursor-up in the sitelistwindow when there was no items selected
   caused an enforcer-hit (this was introduced in 1.594 after a re-write of
   some functions).

   For some reason (probably a ClassAct (mis)feature) it was impossible to close
   the sitelist-window at some times. Things are done differently now to avoid
   this.

   1.594 (released 1996-06-18)
   ===========================

   The windowtitle of the main window now shows how many files you have  
   selected and the amount of bytes they sum to. It also shows how much
   diskspace you have left on the current download device.

   The CLI arguments has changed a bit, if you want to connect to site
   directly at startup you can now write either ftp://[user@@]host[:port][/path]
   or [user]@@host[:port][/path]. You can also write this in the Current 
   site-gadget in the main window. Note that if you type ftp.luth.se/pub/amiga
   you will end up in pub/amiga, and if you type ftp.luth.se//pub/amiga you end
   up in /pub/amiga (which can be different directories in some cases).
   
   Minor bugs fixed.

   1.541 (released 1996-06-05)
   ===========================

   Fixed bug in the Aminet-mode, sometimes it would try to download each file
   twice. Also the 'Get readme'-option was buggy.

   The groupwindow was the same as the sitewindow, now fixed.

   If AmiFTP was iconified during a transfer, it caused an enforcer hit, now
   fixed.

   The installer-script can now be localized (without having several installer-
   icons), currently only English and Spanish are included since I haven't given
   the translators any chance of doing the translation for this release :)
   This works best with the new AT (v43) Installer.

   1.530 (released 1996-05-27)
   ===========================

   Aminet-mode. You can now browse the RECENT-list and see which files are new
   since you visited Aminet the last time. In order to do this all you have to
   do is to define a new site, check the Aminet-gadget and enter '/pub/aminet/'
   in the Remote directory-gadget. Currently you can't upload files in Aminet-
   mode, but that will be fixed in the next version.

   Greek catalog included, thanks to Pantelis Kopelias!

   ARexx FTPCOMMAND now always sets the RC2-variable to the status-number the
   ftp-server returned. Check the RFC-959 if you want to find out what the
   numbers mean. The other ARexx-commands sets the RC2-variable when the server
   replied with an error.

   The menu-command Delete now also deletes directories (on most servers
   only empty directories can be deleted).

   Pressing abort when connecting to a site now closes the connectwindow.

   Fixed a bug in the abort-routine in the Transferwindow.

   Fixed a bug in the Sitelistwindow when moving the cursor-keys (could cause
   some enforcer hits).

   Reorganized the global settings window. Note that closing the window
   with the closegadget is the same as pressing Cancel. Sorry about that
   change, but this is they way it should work.

   New layout in the Transferwindow.

   The sorting-mode is now saved in the preferences-file if you save prefs
   from the 'Settings/Save'-menu.

   1.264 (released 1996-03-09 Aminet-release)
   ==========================================

   An mailing-list for announcing new versions of AmiFTP has been setup.
   If you want to receive a mail when there's a new version available,
   send a mail to lilja@@lysator.liu.se. Note that this is not a discussion-list,
   it's a oneway list, from me to you, the users of AmiFTP.

   Added a group-feature to the sitelist. It's now possible to have
   submenus in the hotlist. Because of this the sort-function has been
   removed, it might come back later.

   Caught a possible memoryleak.

   The menus seemed to forget the state they were in after I had put
   the main window to sleep.

   1.199 (released 1996-02-19)
   ============================

   Better error reporting if AmiFTP can't open a library.

   New ARexx-command: "FTPCOMMAND COMMAND/F" send the supplied string
   directly to the server without doing any checks. With this you can
   do things like 'FTPCOMMAND RMD test" which will tell the server
   to delete the directory called test.

   Fixed a bug in GETATTR that would cause an enforcer hit if a 
   proxy-server wasn't specified.

   1.151 (almost released)
   =======================

   ARexx View-command tried to view the wrong file, now fixed.

   find.amiftp, an aminet search script by Sami Itkonen added to the archive!

   1.149 (released 1996-02-11)
   ===========================

   AmiFTP now supports both AmiTCP and AS225r2/I-Net 225 in one binary. It seems
   like there's a bug in the AS225r2/I-Net 225 part which results in a broken
   connection when you abort AmiFTP, I'm working on it...

   New cli-option and Workbench tooltype added: AS225 This way you can force
   AmiFTP to use AS225/I-Net 225. By default AmiFTP will first try to open 
   bsdsocket.library and if that fails it tries to open socket.library.

   It is now possible do iconify the mainwindow when transferring files. Click
   on the iconify-gadget in the Transfer window. To uniconify you can either
   click on the gadget again, or doubleclick on the icon.

   New ARexx command added: 'VIEW ASCII/S,BIN/S,FILE/A' which will download
   the file to T: and then spawn the viewer (Settings/Global/View command).
   AmiFTP will try to delete the file when you quit AmiFTP.

   New option to SETATTR: 'QUIET/K' Setting QUIET=TRUE makes AmiFTP work 
   in a silent mode where no requester are popped up and the ConnectWindow
   will close directly on failure instead of waiting for user input.
   QUIET=FALSE resets AmiFTP to normal state.
   You can get the current setting with GETATTR STEM=foo, and examine
   foo.QUIET.

   ARexx command 'SETATTR LOCALDIR=foo' didn't update the Download dir-gadget.

   ARexx command 'GETATTR STEM=bar' now works correctly, stupid arexx that only
   recognizes uppercase variables.

   AmiFTP would produce huge amounts of enforcer hits if you tried to
   open it on a public screen that doesn't exist, now fixed.

   Moved the 'Show dot-files?' to the 'Settings'-menu.

   Icelandic catalog added, thanks to Sigurbjörn B. Lárusson!

   Spanish catalog added, thanks to José Roberto González Rocha!

   1.14 (released 1996-01-24)
   ==========================

   An updated installer script is included.

   Forgot to set the busy-pointer when deleting files.

   Gadgets in the main window and the sitelist window no longer
   flickers when you select items.

   The fuelgauge now has 10 intervals instead of the rather odd 9
   it had before.

   Added cliargument/workbench tooltype 'FILEFONT' to specify the font used
   in the main listview (this font is NOT used in the Sitelist-listview).
   Syntax: 'AmiFTP FILEFONT foo.font/8' in order to use size 8 of foo.font.

   1.0 (released 1995-12-17)
   =========================

   First Aminet release.

   Bug in sitelist-window fixed.

   'AmiFTP sitename' (like 'AmiFTP ftp.luth,se') from the command-line now
   works again.

   AmiFTP now looks for AmiFTP.prefs in the following order:
   Current directory
   PROGDIR: (the directory where the AmiFTP-binary resides)
   ENVARC:
   ~user/

   AmiFTP doesn't need amigaguide.library to work any more, but if you don't
   have it you won't be able to get any online help.

   All catalogs are now uptodate.

   -- Beta versions below --

   0.1299
   ======

   Reload-gadget added. Will re-read the current directory from the server.

   Added alphabetically Sorting of the sitenames.

   AmiFTP tries to figure out the correct filesize for links when transferring
   them. That means the size shown in the filelist will not be the actual size
   of the file that the link is pointin to, but it the size information in the
   TransferWindow will be correct. 

   The Danish and German catalogs have not been changed since the last version.
   Check the WWW-page for updates.

   0.1261b
   =======

   I accidentally included some old versions of the gadgets in the 0.1261 
   archive, this release contains the correct versions.

   0.1261
   ======

   AmiFTP should work on 68000/010 systems with the new gadgets/images supplied
   in this archive.

   0.1258
   ======

   I forgot to update the hotlist-menu when a new preferences file was loaded
   or when the sitelist was edited, now fixed.

   Also, current AmiFTP doesn't seem to work on 68000/010 systems. If you do
   have a 000/010 and got AmiFTP to work please contact me.

   0.1235
   ======

   Moved from gadtools-gui to a ClassAct-gui.
   **NOTE** If you already have any ClassAct gadgets installed, you have
   to make sure they are atleast as new as the ones in this archive.
   ClassAct is (C) Phantom Development

   There is not much new in the release compared to 0.864 in terms of
   features.

   This version will probably work with AmigaOS 2.x, I haven't been able
   to verify this yet.


   0.864
   =====

   Getting of entire directory trees added. So if you have problems
   filling up your HD just do a cd to /pub on any aminet-site and
   select the aminet-dir and press 'Get' :)

   A primitive logwindow has been added, it's just a CON: window 
   at the moment. You can open/close it via 'Settings/Log window'.

   It's now possible to add the current site you're connected to
   to the sitelist via the menu 'Project/Add current to sitelist'.

   Added online-help, when you press HELP the correct section in
   AmiFTP.guide will be displayed by AmigaGuide.

   Added default download directory.

   0.776
   =====

   The download-function didn't handle filenames longer than
   32 characters correct.

   The View-function now handles filenames with spaces in.

   When you save the settings via the menu AmiFTP also save the
   window size and position.

   Added ARexx function DELETE, and added the switch FILELIST to 
   GETATTR which returns the current filelist in the STEM-variable. 

   FIXEDFONTNAME/SIZE argument was broken.

   0.699
   =====

   CPS wasn't cleared after each file uploaded.

   Hrm, this time AmiFTP-as225 should really work with mlink (tried
   it myself).

   0.691
   =====

   Links were "View"-ed twice, now fixed.

   Workaround for the V39/gadtools.library bug so the Transfer Window
   looks good on V39 too.

   The 'Bytes transffered' and 'CPS' was updated one time to much.

   Minor things fixed (I forgot to remove some DEBUG-output before
   the previous release).

   0.664
   =====

   When downloading multiple files AmiFTP forgot to unmark them.

   Abort gadget in 'Transfer window' was ghosted after the first file.

   SETATTR USERNAME/PASSWORD works from ARexx now.

   0.648
   =====

   You can now switch transfermodes from the menu (Binary/ASCII),
   default is BINARY.

   The GUI now uses the screens (proportional) font for everything
   but the files-listview. Use the PROPFONTNAME/PROPFONTSIZE and
   FIXEDFONTNAME/FIXEDFONTSIZE Tooltypes/cli arguments to change fonts.

   Lots of small fixes...

   0.535
   =====

   SETTINGS tooltype/cli arguments now works again, it was broken in
   0.533.

   0.533
   =====

   Resume transfer when downloading files added. When AmiFTP ask for
   Overwriting an existing file you can now select between Overwrite,
   Resume transfer, and Cancel.

   Settings-menu added, from where you reach load/save-settings and
   edit hotlist and the old preferences (now renamed to "Global").

   AmiFTP now looks for the prefs-file in the following directories
   (and in this order): Current directory, PROGDIR: (the directory
   where the AmiFTP binary resides), ENV:, ~user/ .

   Default when saving (that is, if AmiFTP couldn't find a prefs-file
   at startup) is PROGDIR:

   AmiFTP is now localized.

   Password-gadget added, AmiFTP will send this password when you're
   not logging in as anonymous.

   0.348
   =====

   The gadgets in SiteList-window got messed up.

   0.345
   =====

   AmiFTP now clones the path when started from Workbench.

   AmiFTP remembers the size and position of the window when iconifying
   it.

   Added directory-cache, AmiFTP will cache up to ten dirs. If you
   enter a directory via the Directory stringgadget in the main
   window the directory will be read from the server, not from the
   cache.

   A special version of AmiFTP now works with mlink, though you can't
   abort filetransfers with it. That version is available from
   http://www.lysator.liu.se/~lilja/AmiFTPmlink.lha

   You can now delete remote files with a new menu-function. A
   requester will pop up asking you if you're really want to delete
   the selected file(s). (I accidentally deleted some files when I
   was testing this function :).

   Select all/unselect all functions available via the menu.

   Links are now shown with (link) in the listview.

   Upload via ARexx added (PUT/MPUT).

   Minor layout-bugs fixed.

   0.275
   =====

   ARexx port added, not all functions are implemented or finished
   yet.

   When View-ing files AmiFTP now downloads them to T: and when
   AmiFTP quits the files will be deleted.
