   DISTRIBUTION


   The main distribution channel for AmiFTP is Aminet (http://www.aminet.org/).
Permission to distribute AmiFTP on disk is granted provided no money except
for the disk is charged. So called 'Commercial distributors of freely
distributable software' are not allowed to distribute AmiFTP without the
authors permission. Permission to distribute AmiFTP via bulletin board
systems and computer networks is granted as long as no money is charged
for accessing or downloading the archive.


   Naturally, the Aminet organization has the permission to include AmiFTP on the
Aminet-CD.


   You may not add/delete files from the AmiFTP archive or create a
new archive with only some of the files and redistribute it unless you have my
permission to do so. This also applies to BBS's that automatically add those
annoying '.display_me' and 'camefrom.bbs' files, I do not want those added
to the AmiFTP-archive.


   If you want to include this program in any package, CD-ROM, coverdisk etc
contact the @@{"author" link "Addresses"} for permission.


   Not all versions of AmiFTP will be uploaded to Aminet, minor updates will be
available from 


     ftp://eniac.campus.luth.se/pub/amiga/amiftp/ and


     http://www.lysator.liu.se/~lilja/amiftp/



   If you want to get a notice via e-mail when new versions are available, write
an e-mail to me (lilja@@lysator.liu.se) and I'll add you to the announce-list.

   @@{b}Registering AmiFTP@@{ub}


   AmiFTP is Shareware. At the moment AmiFTP is not crippled in any way, which
also means that there's no extra functions that are available for users that
register. But if you use AmiFTP and are happy with it (or even if you're unhappy
with it ;) , please consider registering AmiFTP.


   The registration fee is 15 USD, 10 UKP, 20 DEM or 100 SEK. See the @@{"registration form" link "REGISTER/MAIN"} 
for more information on how to register.


   Since there's no extra features available for registered user at the moment
there's no need for a key-file, but if/when I add such features I will send
out keyfiles.


   If you have any questions about registering AmiFTP, don't hesitate to write
an e-mail to me (lilja@@lysator.liu.se).

@@node "Requirements" "Requirements"

   @@{b}Requirements@@{ub}


   In order to run AmiFTP you'll need AmigaOS 2.0 or higher, one of the following
TCP/IP-stacks:


  · AmiTCP 3.0 or higher.


  · AS225r2 or the new I-Net 225.


  · CPR TCP/IP Base Kit.


  · mlink.

  · TermiteTCP.

  
AmiFTP first tries to open AmiTCP's bsdsocket.library and if that failes it opens
socket.library. If you want to force AmiFTP to use socket.library, use the AS225-flag (cli/tooltype option).

In order to detect mlink, AmiFTP searches for a port called "MLINK".

  · reqtools.library

  · The online help in AmiFTP requires amigaguide.library v36 or higher.

   The easiest way to install AmiFTP is to use the supplied Installer-script. To

   Make sure you are using the latest version of the ClassAct system. You can get
it from ftp://ftp.warped.com/pub/amiga/classact/.

   AmiFTP is Shareware. At the moment AmiFTP is not crippled in any way, which also means
that there's no extra functions that are available for users that register. But if you use
AmiFTP and are happy with it (or even if you're unhappy with it ;) , please consider registering AmiFTP.


   The registration fee is $15, or the equivalent in Swedish money. At the moment I can only
accept USD or SEK (cash), I hope to accept more currencies in the future.

   Since there's no extra features available for registered user at the moment there's no
need for a key-file, but if/when I add such features I will send out keyfiles.
d167 3
a169 3
   Now you're probably wondering how to register! It's easy, just send the fee along with
your name, address and e-mail address to @@{"me" link "Addresses"}. I will send an e-mail
confirming your registration.

   If you're using AmiTCP use the binary called 'AmiFTP', AS225r2/mlink users should
use the AmiFTP_as225 binary.

   You also have to make an 'Assign add libs: <directory where window.class is>' or
copy window.class Gadgets and Images to your libs:. Future versions of AmiFTP will
probably not include these gadgets since they will be available on Aminet.

Make sure that the gadgets that you have installed are atleast as new as the ones
supplied in this archive. Using AmiFTP with the gadgets from the old ClassActDemo.lha
will result a crash.

** NOTE ** If you have any ClassAct gadgets/images installed already make sure 
they are atleast as new as the ones in this archive. If you only have the 
versions from the old ClassActDemo from Aminet you _must_ use the files in
the AmiFTP-archive.
