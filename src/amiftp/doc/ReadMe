Welcome to AmiFTP!

Before trying to use AmiFTP you need to run the supplied Install_AmiFTP.
AmiFTP needs ClassAct. Get the latest version from 
ftp://ftp.warped.com/pub/amiga/classact/

I suggest you use the new AT Installer (v43) which can be found
on Aminet.

Note that AmiFTP is Shareware. See AmiFTP.guide for more information.

If someone wants to do the Norwegian and Dutch translations please
contact me. (well, you don't have to do both yourself ;)

Minor updates of AmiFTP will be made available at 
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~lilja/amiftp/ and
ftp://geek.rcc.se/pub/amiga/amiftp/

Major updates will appear on Aminet.
