Version History for AmiFTP

   First a note about the version numbering: AmiFTP will use following
   scheme: majorversion.revision (just like the libraries on your system).
   That means that 1.11 is newer that 1.1, and 1.201 is newer than 1.200
   and 1.20 and so on...

   1.853 (released 1998-01-06)
   ============================

   Minor internal changes, Italian catalog updated.

   1.843 (released 1997-09-29)
   ===========================

   Fixed two ARexx-bugs; GETATTR FILELIST and MGET should now work. If 
   someone still has problems with GET, please e-mail me.

   Added 'Send raw ftp-command' to the project menu.

   Added 'Rename' to the files menu.

   Added 'Create dir' to the files menu.

   Corrected some errors in AmiFTP.guide

   Doubled the maximum length of the ADT pattern string to 512 characters.

   1.814 (released 1996-12-14)
   ===========================

   AmiFTP now saves the correct size of the window.

   Added "Overwrite all"-button to the requester that pops up when a file 
   already exists. The catalogs hasn't been updated to include this string
   yet.

   1.801 (released 1996-11-30)
   ===========================

   Fixed a bug with the filerequester in the global preferences window.
   The bug only seemed to appear on some systems (not mine).

   1.797 (released 1996-11-06)
   ===========================

   Recompiled with SAS/C 6.57.

   Beginning with this version ClassAct will no longer be included in the
   archive. ClassAct is used by so many programs now so you probably already 
   have it. If not, go to ftp://ftp.warped.com/pub/amiga/classact/ .

   Not all language catalogs have been updated.

   Sometimes you had to press HELP two times in order to get the online
   help. Fixed now.

   Speedbar added, and preferences to turn on/off the speedbar and the normal
   buttons.

   ClassAct no longer included in the archive. Get the latest version from
   ftp.warped.com/pub/amiga/classact/ .

   All button-actions are duplicated as menu items.

   Bug in the progressbar fixed.

   AmiFTP starts even if no TCP/IP-stack is running.

   You can now select files by entering a AmigaDOS-pattern (in the Files-menu).

   You can use the cursor keys to scroll the filelist. (and use shift/alt to
   scroll a page/go to top/bottom).

   Various minor things fixed.

   1.607 (released 1996-07-01)
   ===========================

   Due to a bug in the current penmap.image, AmiFTP won't work on AmigaOS 2.x,
   but when penmap.image has been fixed it will.
   
   A NewIcon-style icon for AmiFTP has been included as well as a KMI-style
   dock-icon. Thanks to Phil Vedovatti and Heikki Kantola.

   Pressing cursor-up in the sitelistwindow when there was no items selected
   caused an enforcer-hit (this was introduced in 1.594 after a re-write of
   some functions).

   For some reason (probably a ClassAct (mis)feature) it was impossible to close
   the sitelist-window at some times. Things are done differently now to avoid
   this.

   1.594 (released 1996-06-18)
   ===========================

   The windowtitle of the main window now shows how many files you have  
   selected and the amount of bytes they sum to. It also shows how much
   diskspace you have left on the current download device.

   The CLI arguments has changed a bit, if you want to connect to site
   directly at startup you can now write either ftp://[user@]host[:port][/path]
   or [user]@host[:port][/path]. You can also write this in the Current 
   site-gadget in the main window. Note that if you type ftp.luth.se/pub/amiga
   you will end up in pub/amiga, and if you type ftp.luth.se//pub/amiga you end
   up in /pub/amiga (which can be different directories in some cases).
   
   Minor bugs fixed.

   1.541 (released 1996-06-05)
   ===========================

   Fixed bug in the Aminet-mode, sometimes it would try to download each file
   twice. Also the 'Get readme'-option was buggy.

   The groupwindow was the same as the sitewindow, now fixed.

   If AmiFTP was iconified during a transfer, it caused an enforcer hit, now
   fixed.

   The installer-script can now be localized (without having several installer-
   icons), currently only English and Spanish are included since I haven't given
   the translators any chance of doing the translation for this release :)
   This works best with the new AT (v43) Installer.

   1.530 (released 1996-05-27)
   ===========================

   Aminet-mode. You can now browse the RECENT-list and see which files are new
   since you visited Aminet the last time. In order to do this all you have to
   do is to define a new site, check the Aminet-gadget and enter '/pub/aminet/'
   in the Remote directory-gadget. Currently you can't upload files in Aminet-
   mode, but that will be fixed in the next version.

   Greek catalog included, thanks to Pantelis Kopelias!

   ARexx FTPCOMMAND now always sets the RC2-variable to the status-number the
   ftp-server returned. Check the RFC-959 if you want to find out what the
   numbers mean. The other ARexx-commands sets the RC2-variable when the server
   replied with an error.

   The menu-command Delete now also deletes directories (on most servers
   only empty directories can be deleted).

   Pressing abort when connecting to a site now closes the connectwindow.

   Fixed a bug in the abort-routine in the Transferwindow.

   Fixed a bug in the Sitelistwindow when moving the cursor-keys (could cause
   some enforcer hits).

   Reorganized the global settings window. Note that closing the window
   with the closegadget is the same as pressing Cancel. Sorry about that
   change, but this is they way it should work.

   New layout in the Transferwindow.

   The sorting-mode is now saved in the preferences-file if you save prefs
   from the 'Settings/Save'-menu.

   1.264 (released 1996-03-09 Aminet-release)
   ==========================================

   An mailing-list for announcing new versions of AmiFTP has been setup.
   If you want to receive a mail when there's a new version available,
   send a mail to lilja@lysator.liu.se. Note that this is not a discussion-list,
   it's a oneway list, from me to you, the users of AmiFTP.

   Added a group-feature to the sitelist. It's now possible to have
   submenus in the hotlist. Because of this the sort-function has been
   removed, it might come back later.

   Caught a possible memoryleak.

   The menus seemed to forget the state they were in after I had put
   the main window to sleep.

   1.199 (released 1996-02-19)
   ============================

   Better error reporting if AmiFTP can't open a library.

   New ARexx-command: "FTPCOMMAND COMMAND/F" send the supplied string
   directly to the server without doing any checks. With this you can
   do things like 'FTPCOMMAND RMD test" which will tell the server
   to delete the directory called test.

   Fixed a bug in GETATTR that would cause an enforcer hit if a 
   proxy-server wasn't specified.

   1.151 (almost released)
   =======================

   ARexx View-command tried to view the wrong file, now fixed.

   find.amiftp, an aminet search script by Sami Itkonen added to the archive!

   1.149 (released 1996-02-11)
   ===========================

   AmiFTP now supports both AmiTCP and AS225r2/I-Net 225 in one binary. It seems
   like there's a bug in the AS225r2/I-Net 225 part which results in a broken
   connection when you abort AmiFTP, I'm working on it...

   New cli-option and Workbench tooltype added: AS225 This way you can force
   AmiFTP to use AS225/I-Net 225. By default AmiFTP will first try to open 
   bsdsocket.library and if that fails it tries to open socket.library.

   It is now possible do iconify the mainwindow when transferring files. Click
   on the iconify-gadget in the Transfer window. To uniconify you can either
   click on the gadget again, or doubleclick on the icon.

   New ARexx command added: 'VIEW ASCII/S,BIN/S,FILE/A' which will download
   the file to T: and then spawn the viewer (Settings/Global/View command).
   AmiFTP will try to delete the file when you quit AmiFTP.

   New option to SETATTR: 'QUIET/K' Setting QUIET=TRUE makes AmiFTP work 
   in a silent mode where no requester are popped up and the ConnectWindow
   will close directly on failure instead of waiting for user input.
   QUIET=FALSE resets AmiFTP to normal state.
   You can get the current setting with GETATTR STEM=foo, and examine
   foo.QUIET.

   ARexx command 'SETATTR LOCALDIR=foo' didn't update the Download dir-gadget.

   ARexx command 'GETATTR STEM=bar' now works correctly, stupid arexx that only
   recognizes uppercase variables.

   AmiFTP would produce huge amounts of enforcer hits if you tried to
   open it on a public screen that doesn't exist, now fixed.

   Moved the 'Show dot-files?' to the 'Settings'-menu.

   Icelandic catalog added, thanks to Sigurbjörn B. Lárusson!

   Spanish catalog added, thanks to José Roberto González Rocha!

   1.14 (released 1996-01-24)
   ==========================

   An updated installer script is included.

   Forgot to set the busy-pointer when deleting files.

   Gadgets in the main window and the sitelist window no longer
   flickers when you select items.

   The fuelgauge now has 10 intervals instead of the rather odd 9
   it had before.

   Added cliargument/workbench tooltype 'FILEFONT' to specify the font used
   in the main listview (this font is NOT used in the Sitelist-listview).
   Syntax: 'AmiFTP FILEFONT foo.font/8' in order to use size 8 of foo.font.

   1.0 (released 1995-12-17)
   =========================

   First Aminet release.
