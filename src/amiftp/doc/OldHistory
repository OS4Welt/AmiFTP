   Bug in sitelist-window fixed.

   'AmiFTP sitename' (like 'AmiFTP ftp.luth,se') from the command-line now
   works again.

   AmiFTP now looks for AmiFTP.prefs in the following order:
   Current directory
   PROGDIR: (the directory where the AmiFTP-binary resides)
   ENVARC:
   ~user/

   AmiFTP doesn't need amigaguide.library to work any more, but if you don't
   have it you won't be able to get any online help.

   All catalogs are now uptodate.

   -- Beta versions below --

   0.1299
   ======

   Reload-gadget added. Will re-read the current directory from the server.

   Added alphabetically Sorting of the sitenames.

   AmiFTP tries to figure out the correct filesize for links when transferring
   them. That means the size shown in the filelist will not be the actual size
   of the file that the link is pointin to, but it the size information in the
   TransferWindow will be correct. 

   The Danish and German catalogs have not been changed since the last version.
   Check the WWW-page for updates.

   0.1261b
   =======

   I accidentally included some old versions of the gadgets in the 0.1261 
   archive, this release contains the correct versions.

   0.1261
   ======

   AmiFTP should work on 68000/010 systems with the new gadgets/images supplied
   in this archive.

   0.1258
   ======

   I forgot to update the hotlist-menu when a new preferences file was loaded
   or when the sitelist was edited, now fixed.

   Also, current AmiFTP doesn't seem to work on 68000/010 systems. If you do
   have a 000/010 and got AmiFTP to work please contact me.

   0.1235
   ======

   Moved from gadtools-gui to a ClassAct-gui.
   **NOTE** If you already have any ClassAct gadgets installed, you have
   to make sure they are atleast as new as the ones in this archive.
   ClassAct is (C) Phantom Development

   There is not much new in the release compared to 0.864 in terms of
   features.

   This version will probably work with AmigaOS 2.x, I haven't been able
   to verify this yet.


   0.864
   =====

   Getting of entire directory trees added. So if you have problems
   filling up your HD just do a cd to /pub on any aminet-site and
   select the aminet-dir and press 'Get' :)

   A primitive logwindow has been added, it's just a CON: window 
   at the moment. You can open/close it via 'Settings/Log window'.

   It's now possible to add the current site you're connected to
   to the sitelist via the menu 'Project/Add current to sitelist'.

   Added online-help, when you press HELP the correct section in
   AmiFTP.guide will be displayed by AmigaGuide.

   Added default download directory.

   0.776
   =====

   The download-function didn't handle filenames longer than
   32 characters correct.

   The View-function now handles filenames with spaces in.

   When you save the settings via the menu AmiFTP also save the
   window size and position.

   Added ARexx function DELETE, and added the switch FILELIST to 
   GETATTR which returns the current filelist in the STEM-variable. 

   FIXEDFONTNAME/SIZE argument was broken.

   0.699
   =====

   CPS wasn't cleared after each file uploaded.

   Hrm, this time AmiFTP-as225 should really work with mlink (tried
   it myself).

   0.691
   =====

   Links were "View"-ed twice, now fixed.

   Workaround for the V39/gadtools.library bug so the Transfer Window
   looks good on V39 too.

   The 'Bytes transffered' and 'CPS' was updated one time to much.

   Minor things fixed (I forgot to remove some DEBUG-output before
   the previous release).

   0.664
   =====

   When downloading multiple files AmiFTP forgot to unmark them.

   Abort gadget in 'Transfer window' was ghosted after the first file.

   SETATTR USERNAME/PASSWORD works from ARexx now.

   0.648
   =====

   You can now switch transfermodes from the menu (Binary/ASCII),
   default is BINARY.

   The GUI now uses the screens (proportional) font for everything
   but the files-listview. Use the PROPFONTNAME/PROPFONTSIZE and
   FIXEDFONTNAME/FIXEDFONTSIZE Tooltypes/cli arguments to change fonts.

   Lots of small fixes...

   0.535
   =====

   SETTINGS tooltype/cli arguments now works again, it was broken in
   0.533.

   0.533
   =====

   Resume transfer when downloading files added. When AmiFTP ask for
   Overwriting an existing file you can now select between Overwrite,
   Resume transfer, and Cancel.

   Settings-menu added, from where you reach load/save-settings and
   edit hotlist and the old preferences (now renamed to "Global").

   AmiFTP now looks for the prefs-file in the following directories
   (and in this order): Current directory, PROGDIR: (the directory
   where the AmiFTP binary resides), ENV:, ~user/ .

   Default when saving (that is, if AmiFTP couldn't find a prefs-file
   at startup) is PROGDIR:

   AmiFTP is now localized.

   Password-gadget added, AmiFTP will send this password when you're
   not logging in as anonymous.

   0.348
   =====

   The gadgets in SiteList-window got messed up.

   0.345
   =====

   AmiFTP now clones the path when started from Workbench.

   AmiFTP remembers the size and position of the window when iconifying
   it.

   Added directory-cache, AmiFTP will cache up to ten dirs. If you
   enter a directory via the Directory stringgadget in the main
   window the directory will be read from the server, not from the
   cache.

   A special version of AmiFTP now works with mlink, though you can't
   abort filetransfers with it. That version is available from
   http://www.lysator.liu.se/~lilja/AmiFTPmlink.lha

   You can now delete remote files with a new menu-function. A
   requester will pop up asking you if you're really want to delete
   the selected file(s). (I accidentally deleted some files when I
   was testing this function :).

   Select all/unselect all functions available via the menu.

   Links are now shown with (link) in the listview.

   AmiFTP quits the files will be deleted.
